      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>What is Citymail?</h3>
        <p>
          Citymail is a student e-mail system based on Outlook Live Exchange.
          Microsoft hosts the service, while CUNY manages it, allowing each
          college to customize it. It offers e-mail, calendar, cloud storage,
          mobile access, and more.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>What else do I get with Citymail?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Windows Office Live Workspace</li>
          <li>Windows Live Messenger</li>
          <li>Mobile access to IM and e-mail</li>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Is Citymail required?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Accounts are automatically created. Students are expected to

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Why must I use my student e-mail for college business?</h3>
        <p>
          Your student e-mail address is uniquely assigned to you and used by
          over 200 administrative offices to verify your identity. It is also
          used to access services such as Wi-Fi, Blackboard, CUNYfirst,
          DegreeWorks, and more.
